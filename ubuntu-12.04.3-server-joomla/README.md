This is for a box I needed to run a joomla site. 

I'm using erb and symlinks here to try and "derive" this box from the base ubuntu server box so I don't have to repeat the basics in a template again. Sure would be cool if packer supported some sort of derived packer templates intrinsically.

See build.sh for exactly how to process the template and start the box.
